information collected in connection with IronBox’s Apps.
BY INSTALLING, USING, REGISTERING TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING ANY APPS, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND GIVE AN EXPLICIT AND INFORMED CONSENT TO THE 
STORAGE, USE, AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT

Non-personal Data:

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “non-personal data” means information that does not directly identify you, which may include your age, weight, and 
gender. Additionally, non-personal data includes “aggregate” and “de-personalized” information, which is data IronBox collects about the use of IronBox App, 
from which any personally identifiable data has been removed.
IronBox collects non-personal data from you to make your use of the Apps more efficient and useful. For example, if you provide non-personal data about you, the 
App may provide certain information about your workout such as calories burned or other tailored calculations about your workout.
IronBox also uses tools and third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not directly enable IronBox  to 
identify you. The types of non-personal data IronBox may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to 
unique device identifier or other device identifier (“UDID”); (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data 
such as zip code, area code and location; (v) game score and achievements; (vi) other non-personal data as reasonably required by IronBox to enhance the Apps 
and other IronBox products and services.
IronBox shares non-personal data, including both data you provide to IronBox and data which is automatically collected, with IronBox’s partners and 
contractors for purposes of analyzing usage of the Apps, advertisement serving, managing and providing the Apps, and to further develop the Apps and 
other IronBox services and products.
You recognize and agree that the analytics companies utilized by IronBox may combine the information collected with other information they have independently 
collected from other services or products relating to your activities. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.

Ad Serving Technology:

IronBox reserves the right to use and disclose collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by IronBox or IronBox’s partners and contractors. 
IronBox employs third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result of ad serving through Apps. IronBox or third 
parties operating the ad serving technology may use your demographic and location information, non-personal data you provide to IronBox, and information logged 
from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Service. IronBox or third parties may collect and use data for this 
purpose including, but not limited to IP address (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), UDID, software, applications, 
hardware, browser information, internet and on-line usage information and in-game information. The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance 
with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.
You recognize and agree that the advertising companies who deliver ads for IronBox may combine the information collected with other information they have 
independently collected from other services or products. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. These ad serving 
technologies are integrated into Apps; if you do not want to be subject to this technology, do not use or access Apps. Although IronBox with the terms and 
conditions of this Privacy Policy, IronBox does not have access to or control of third party technologies.

Personal Data:

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal data” means personally identifiable information that specifically identifies you as an individual.
Likely situations when you make personal data available to IronBox include, but are not limited to: (i) registration for Apps, contests and special 
events; (ii) accessing Apps using a third party ID, such as social networking sites or gaming services; (iii) subscribing to newsletters; (iv) purchasing a 
product or services through IronBox’s online stores; (v) using “tell a friend,” “email this page,” or other similar features; (vi) requesting technical support; 
and (vii) otherwise through use of IronBox’s Apps where personal data is required for use and/or participation.

address, friend connections, avatar image, credit card information, shipping information; and location (only if directly identifiable to you, otherwise IronBox 
treats location as non-personal data).
IronBox may use collected personal data for purposes of analyzing usage of the Apps, providing customer and technical support, managing and providing Apps 
(including managing advertisement serving) and to further develop the Apps and other IronBox services and products. IronBox may combine non-personal data with 
personal data.
IronBox may use your personal data to send messages to you with informative and/or commercial content about IronBox’s services or third party products and 
services IronBox thinks may be of interest to you, such as new features and services, special offers and updated information.

picture, gender, user ID, email address, your country, your language, your time zone, the organizations and links on your profile page, the names and profile

affiliated companies in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
IronBox may hire agents and contractors to collect and process personal data on IronBox’s behalf and in such cases such agents and contractors will be 
instructed to comply with our Privacy Policy and to use personal data only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by IronBox. These 
agents and contractors may not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes. IronBox may use third party service providers such as credit card 
processors, e-mail service providers, shipping agents, data analyzers and business intelligence providers. IronBox has the right to share your personal 
data as necessary for the aforementioned third parties to provide their services for IronBox. IronBox is not liable for the acts and omissions of these 
third parties, except as provided by applicable law.
IronBox may disclose your personal data to third parties as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of 
fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or IronBox to legal liability. IronBox may also disclose your 
personal data to third parties when IronBox has a reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with 
IronBox’s rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or IronBox believes that such disclosure is necessary 
to protect IronBox’s rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on IronBox. To the extent permitted by 
applicable law, IronBox will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such disclosure through IronBox’s website or in another reasonable manner.

IronBox retains the data collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a 
longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Thereafter if the collected data is no longer needed for purposes specified in this Privacy Policy, 
IronBox deletes all aforementioned data in our possession within a reasonable timeframe. IronBox does not verify the correctness of personal data.

IronBox follows generally accepted industry standards and maintains reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the

accordance with the purposes of this Privacy Policy and for the purposes of performing technical maintenance, have access to your personal data in IronBox’s 
possession. Personal data collected by IronBox is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. To prevent unauthorized on-line
access to personal data, IronBox maintains personal data behind a firewall-protected server. However, no system can be 100% secure and there is the possibility

not be liable for any misappropriation or theft of your personal data.

chats or the like is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality. IronBox is not responsible for any personal data you choose 
to make public in any of these forums.
If you are under 15 years of age or a minor in your country of residence, please ask your legal guardian’s permission to use or access the Apps. IronBox takes
children’s privacy seriously, and encourages parents and/or guardians to play an active role in their children’s online experience at all times. IronBox does

any due diligence process provided, however, that this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern such personal data.
If you have any questions or comments about IronBox’s privacy practices, would like to stop receiving information from IronBox, or would like to correct or
